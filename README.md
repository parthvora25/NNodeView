# NNodeView
NNodeView is a N-Level nodeview that can be expanded and collapsed upto n number of nodes. Also you wiill get a predefined inbuilt method(function), which is created by me to directly add the parent child combination in the node adapter. The demo app is not properly designed, that can be managed after all the functionality is done.
